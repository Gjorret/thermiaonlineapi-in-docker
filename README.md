# thermiaonlineapi-in-docker
Dockerfile for https://hub.docker.com/r/gjorret/thermia-online-api

Trying out creating a docker image.

This is work in progress and im a newb @ docker containers, so dont expect the most of it.

This image will deploy a container fetching newest version of the Thermia-Online-Api (https://github.com/klejejs/python-thermia-online-api) via https://pypi.org/project/ThermiaOnlineAPI/

For now it just downloads the example.py from GitHub.
